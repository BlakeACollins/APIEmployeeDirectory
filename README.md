# APIEmployeeDirectory

This is project 8 for Front End Web Development Techdegree at Treehouse.

Awesome Startup is a distributed company with employees working all over the world. They need a smart way to for employees to share contact information with each other. In this project, I used the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random “employees”, and use that data to build a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory. I requested a JSON object from the API using fetch and parse the data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee’s image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address.


# Overall Comments
"Fantastic job on this one! You have shown a deep understanding of pulling and parsing data from a 3rd party API and manipulating the HTML DOM using JavaScript! Keep up the good work and happy coding! You are in the final stretch!"
